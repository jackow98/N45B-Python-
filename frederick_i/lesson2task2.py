# Mr walker's feedback
# Good start, just be careful with spacing and brackets

upperLimit = 105
lowerLimit = 100

# Be careful with spacing and brackets
weightRounded = round(104.4991, 1)

# You need to add in an if statement to check
if weightRounded < upperLimit and weightRounded > lowerLimit:
    print("Boxer qualifies")
else:
    print("Boxer does not qualify")
