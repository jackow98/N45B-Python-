# Mr walker's feedback
# Good try, be careful with your maths for average

# You have copied these over incorrectly, be careful! I have fixed below
qualifierGames = 7
qualifierGoals = 15
eurosGames = 8
eurosGoals = 22

totalGames = qualifierGames + eurosGames
totalGoals = qualifierGoals + eurosGoals

# You need to divide by number of games, not 2!
average = totalGoals / totalGames

print('The total games are', + totalGames)
print('The total goals are', + totalGoals)
print('and the average is', + average)
