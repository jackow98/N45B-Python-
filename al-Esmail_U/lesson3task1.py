# Mr walker's feedback
# Great work, just be careful with variable names
# swimsecs should be swimSecs or swim_secs

swimSecs = []
for loop in range(10):
    swimsecs = int(input("what was your time?"))
    # You don't need brackets here
    swimminsro = swimsecs / 60
    swimmins = round(swimminsro, 1)
    print(swimmins)
