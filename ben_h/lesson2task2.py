# Mr walker's feedback
# Good start, you just needed a few more lines

# Be careful, you copied this number wrong
total = 104.4991
rounded = round(total, 1)

# You need to add in an if statement to check
if rounded < 105 and rounded > 100:
    print("Boxer qualifies")
else:
    print("Boxer does not qualify")
